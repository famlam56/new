            <h2 class="in">Introduction</h2>
            <div class="top"></div>
            <p class="p">Kosgoda is a small town in the Galle District, Southern Province, Sri Lanka. It is situated on
                the southwestern coast of
                Sri Lanka, approximately 50 km (31 mi) south of Galle and 76 km (47 mi) south of Colombo.
                The town is known for its turtle nesting areas, where five (green, olive ridley, loggerhead, hawksbill
                and leatherback turtles)
                of the seven species of marine turtles' nest on the local beaches.In 1981 a turtle hatchery was
                established to protect the eggs
                of sea turtles that lay their eggs on the nearby beaches. The hatchery collects the eggs and incubates
                them in a controlled
                environment, before releasing the hatchlings back into the ocean once they are ready.</p>
            <div class="top"></div>
            <p class="p"> The hatchery is run by the Wild Life and
                Nature Protection Society.In addition to its turtle hatcheries, Kosgoda is also known for its beaches,
                Kosgoda River and traditional
                fishing industry. The town is home to a number of hotels, villas and small guesthouses.
            </p>
            <div class="top"></div>
            <p class="p"> The local economy is largely dependent on fishing, tourism, and the production of coconut and
                cinnamon based products.The town is home to several small-scale factories that produce coconut oil,
                coconut fibre, and other products made from coconut.
                Kosgoda has a long history of Buddhist worship, and it is home to a number of ancient temples and
                religious sites. The most notable of these is the Kosgoda Raja Maha Viharaya, a Buddhist temple that
                dates back to the 16th century.
                In recent years, Kosgoda has become a popular destination for eco-tourism. In addition to its turtle
                hatchery, the town also offers opportunities for bird watching, canoeing, and other outdoor activities.
                The nearby beaches and forests are home to a variety of wildlife.

            <div class="top"></div>
            <p class="p">KSTCP is proud to host international volunteers who assist with the operation of the project
                and/or undertake local community development projects. In return, volunteers gain valuable experience
                participating in local projects - learning about turtles, turtle conservation, the local community, Sri
                Lanka and plenty more besides! Placements with the project commence from one week to twelve week
                duration.
            </p>

            </div>
            <div class="top"></div>
            <p class="p">Volunteers are based in Kosgoda at homestay accommodation with Dudley and his family. Here
                volunteers live, learn and work together (and play!); all to a warm welcome and hospitality from the
                Pereras and a table full of home-cooked food.
            </p>
            <div class="top"></div>
            <p class="p">See the link to the right for some first-hand accounts by some of our volunteers. For those
                returning volunteers, please do add your experiences to the guestbook.
                Volunteering at the KSTCP is a very hands-on experience involving beach conservation work, maintenance
                of the turtle hatchery, turtle feeding (and cleaning!) and even taking tours round the project for
                locals and tourists! There's a lot to learn about turtles and Sri Lanka but it's not something you will
                forget quickly.Volunteers have free time at the weekend. With this free time volunteers can visit places
                of interest such as Kandy, Sigiriya, Dambulla, Anuradhapura, Ella, Nuwara Eliya, Mirissa, Galle and
                Yala. Such tours can be arranged with local guides via the Project.
